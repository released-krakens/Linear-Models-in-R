#### CASE: Historical changes in the abundance of the Caribbean sea urchin Diadema antillarum ####

# D.antillarum is a keystone species that modulates the competitive interaction between sessile, slow-growing organisms
# and fast-growing macroalgae on Caribbean reefs through grazing. 
# In the 1980's a massive die-off of the sea urchin reduced its population throughout the region, disappearing in many reefs. 
# This decline contributed to phase shifts where macralgae started dominating reefs that were previously dominated by reef-building corals.

### Research Question ###
# Do area-based conservation strategies, such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
# help in the mainteinance and/or recovery of D. antillarum populations?

### The Sampling Design ###

# A nested design is employ surveying at least three sites  in a coral reef MPA and the same amount 
# on a similar coral reefs that is not protected. The number of sea urchins were ocunted along
# a 100m^2 belt transect by one SCUBA diver, completing 8 transects on each site
# 4 on the reef terrace (6m depth) and 4 on the reef slop (15m depth)


### Experimental Design ###

## Abundance of D antillarum: response variable. Continous  if density is used (number of urchins/m^2). Ordinal if counts are used.
## Year (Y): Factor with 10 levels: 2000, 2001, 2002.....2010
## Reef (R): Factor with 2 levels: MPA and non-MPA. Fixed if the reefs were not chosen randomly from a population of MPAs and non-MPAs.
## Site (S): Factor, nested in Reef with 4 levels.
## Reef Location (RL): Factor fixed with two levels: terrace and slope.
## Transects: replicates. N= 10Y*2R*4S*2RL=160


# Considering sites as nested on Reef. You have two possibilities, using Year as fixed or introducing random effects for both Year and Site. 
# Let me explain the difference. You might want to answer the following questions/hypotheses


# Does the abundance of D. antillarum differ between the MPA and no-MPA? | H: the abundance of D. antillarum is higher on the MPA
# Does it vary from reef terrace to the slope?  | H: the abundance of D. antillarum is higher on reef terrace compared to the slope 
# Does it vary with Year?  |  H: You in fact have no hypothesis associated with year. If you assume the population decreased considerably in the 1980s on # both reefs (MPA and non-MPA), then you would expect it to have increased in time on the MPA and not on the other reef.The latter would be an interaction.
# Does variation among any of the levels of these, depend on any other? (Interactions)

# However, there are additional sources of variability:
# Site Variability: Even if you randomly select sites within each location every year, 
# some sites might inherently have naturally higher abundances. 
# This inherent variability among sites is not directly related to the impact an R, Y and/or RL

# Sites as a random effect: If you are less concerned about the differences between specific sites 
# and more concerned about the overall effect of R and RL, you can treat sites as a random effect to account for the random variability between sites.

# The rationale behind introducing these random effects is to account for the variability 
# introduced by these factors without making specific conclusions about them. 
# This can help you get more accurate and generalizable results for the fixed factors you are truly interested in.

# Let us build the model with sites as random effects
